## Members
Adam Owada - Natalie Sinner - Dipendra Khatri - Lami Beach

## How to Play
- Test your Harry Potter knowledge and see if you can escape the Forbidden Forest. 
- When given a prompt, use your knowledge to journey through the Forbidden Forest. 
- If you get a question incorrect, you die!
- Luckily, we created local storage and you can try again. 
- Choose a Harry Potter character then enter a wizard name, click submit. 
- Create a new game by entering a new wizard name, or continue a game by entering an existing name.
